# problem-solve
I always have a strong interest in knowing great peoples of my field like software development and programming. Knowing about them, following them, and reading about them not only gives you immense knowledge but also the motivation ,you need to excel in whatever you are doing. It's the motivation, not knowledge that will propel your career.
